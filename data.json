Charlie has tailored the lessons to cover advanced topics such as playing with odd time signatures, music theory (extended chords, Modal theory) and Improvisation skills (playing over changes, modal interchange, arpeggio development). It has been great to solidify my previous/current knowledge and help fill in any gaps and getting me to tackle subjects i was struggling with. His supporting resources such as transcriptions are always flawless. Charlie has a great understanding of music and imparting that information to his students."

He knows music theory, guitar techniques and different music genres and styles to the detail. I couldn't think of anyone better if you are looking for expanding your musical horizons. I have no doubt that he has the training and experience to be a great teacher. He is close and easy to talk to, and he is able of helping, guiding and teaching you in the best way possible."

Charlie's friendly and fun approach immediately won Richie over and he has loved playing the guitar ever since. Charlie was able to adapt when Richie floated, undecided, between acoustic and electric guitar and offered good advice for both.  Richie has come on in leaps & bounds since starting with Charlie, will now sit and happily practice and is proud of his progress. Charlie always has a lesson planned and goals for Richie but is flexible where necessary and always patient and kind. He has provided professional advice on instruments, equipment and progression for Richie and is a great communicator both with Richie and my husband and I. Charlie is dependable and trustworthy and I highly recommend him as a guitar teacher!"
